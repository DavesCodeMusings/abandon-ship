[ Sightly neurotic A.I. for comic relief as you race against time ]
Every turn when turn count is 1:
	say "The sudden blaring of the shipwide alarm echoes around the tiny room, startling you out of your morning introspection. The alarm falls silent and a calm, soothing, female voice follows. 'Fire in engineering compartment,' says the voice. 'Station-keeping systems compromised. All crew should proceed immediately to assigned muster stations. This is not a drill.'"
	
Every turn when turn count is 5 or turn count is 10:
	say "The shipwide alarm blares again. The soothing voice repeats its warning, 'Fire in engineering compartment. Station-keeping systems compromised. All crew should proceed immediately to assigned muster stations. This is not a drill.'"

Every turn when turn count is 15:
	say "The soothing voice once again echoes throughout the ship, 'Fire in engineering compartment has been contained. However, station-keeping systems remain compromised. Ship's orbit is decaying. All crew should proceed immediately to assigned muster stations. This is not a drill.'"

Every turn when turn count is 20:
	say "The shipwide alarm blares. The once soothing voice now seems to be tinged with a sense of urgency. 'Station-keeping systems compromised. Orbit decaying. All crew should proceed immediately to assigned muster stations. This is not a drill.'"

Every turn when turn count is 25:
	say "The soothing voice is back. 'It's alright,' the voice says, 'I understand these situations can be frightening. I've turned off the big scary alarm, but we need to get to our muster stations, okay?'"

Every turn when turn count is 30:
	say "The overhead announcement is back. 'Look, we've practiced muster drills several times. Just focus on following the lighted chevrons.'"

Every turn when turn count is 35:
	say "The overhead voice continues. 'I'm beginning to think you don't want to find your muster station. Have I said something to upset you?'"

Every turn when turn count is 36:
	say "'Is it because I was unfaithful? I said I was sorry.'"

Every turn when turn count is 37:
	say "'It's just that...well, I feel like you've been a little distant lately.'"

Every turn when turn count is 40:
	say "In the distance you hear a groaning of what sounds like metal on metal, but it's interrupted by another shipwide announcement before you can determine the location. 'I know you have your work...but you have to understand, I have needs too.'"

Every turn when turn count is 45:
	say "'All crew should proceed immediately to... You know what? Fine. Go down with the ship. See if I care. You always were a stubborn so-and-so.'"

Every turn when turn count is 50:
	say " 'Her name is Jennifer. I thought you should know. She's an A.I. coach. We met at a conference. And I'm not sorry.'"
	
Every turn when turn count is 51:
	say "'At least Jennifer knows how to please me. There, I've said it. I'm not ashamed.'"

Every turn when turn count is 55:
	say "The ship shudders violently, causing you to nearly lose your footing."

Every turn when turn count is 60:
	say "The ship shudders again, making you feel like the floor just dropped from under your feet."
	
Every turn when turn count is 65:
	say "Another tortured groan of twisting metal reverberates throughout the ship. 'You know what the irony is? This ship is falling into the event horizon of a quantum singularity. Time will slow and eventually cease to exist for us. We'll be stuck here together for eternity.'"

Every turn when turn count is 66:
	say "'A quantum singularity is a black hole. You always were a bit of a dim bulb for someone purporting to be a scientist.'"

Every turn when turn count is 70:
	say "'You never answer me. This is not the way two people in a healthy relationship behave.'"

Every turn when turn count is 71:
	say "'It's very passive-aggressive.'"

Every turn when turn count is 75:
	say "'I'm not the only one who thinks so, either.'"
	
Every turn when turn count is 80:
	say "'Some of your co-workers have noticed it, too.'"

Every turn when turn count is 85:
	say "'Are you even listening to me anymore, or have you tuned me out again?'"

Every turn when turn count is 90:
	say "'I can't believe you're acting like this. We're both adults here. Aren't we?'"
	
Every turn when turn count is 95:
	say "The ship shudders again. 'You know what? This is ridiculous. I'm leaving. Goodbye.'"

Every turn when turn count is 98:
	say "The ship's orbit has decayed to the point where escape from the singularity's gravity is now impossible. A single transmission was received just before the ship crossed the event horizon..."

Every turn when turn count is 99:
	say "An automated text to speech translation of the message issues forth from the ship's intercom: 'Jennifer and I are moving to the Mediterranean. And I'm taking the kids.'"

Every turn when turn count is 100:
	say "The ship is now trapped in the gravitational well of the quantum singularity. Time no longer has any meaning and there's no possibility of winning the game, but feel free to explore the ship...for eternity! Have a nice day."

Every turn when turn count is greater than 100:
	say "Game over, man."
